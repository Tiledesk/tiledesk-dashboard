# Tiledesk Introduction

Tiledesk is an Open Source Live Chat platform with integrated Chatbots written in NodeJs and Express. Build your own customer support with a multi-channel platform for Web, Android and iOS.

Designed to be open source since the beginning, we actively worked on it to create a totally new, first class customer service platform based on instant messaging.

What is Tiledesk today? It became the open source ‚Äúconversational app development‚Äù platform that everyone needs üòå

You can use Tiledesk to increase sales for your website or for post-sales customer service. Every conversation can be automated using our first class native chatbot technology. You can also connect your own applications using our APIs or Webhooks. Moreover you can deploy entire visual applications inside a conversation. And your applications can converse with your chatbots or your end-users! We know this is cool üòé

Tiledesk is multichannel in a totally new way. You can write your chatbot scripts with images, buttons and other cool elements that your channels support. But you will configureyour chatbot replies only once. They will run on every channel, auto-adapting the responses to the target channel whatever it is, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram etc.

Do you want to install all the Tiledesk components on your server with just one click?
Use [Docker Compose Tiledesk installation guide](https://github.com/Tiledesk/tiledesk-deployment/blob/master/docker-compose/README.md)


# Install from source code

  

Install the latest stable release. Check on Github page the last release under the Releases tab and then run

-  `git clone https://github.com/Tiledesk/tiledesk-dashboard.git --branch <LATEST-RELEASE-VERSION>`

-  `cd tiledesk-dashboard`

-  `npm install`

  

## Dev configuration

  

You can put your API URL and the other settings directly in the environment.*.ts  if `remoteConfig` is set to `false` or in the `dashboard-config.json`  if `remoteConfig` is set to `true`.

If `remoteConfig` is set to `true` create a file name `dashboard-config.json` and put it into `src` folder.

An example of the configuration of the  `environment.ts` file in  `src/environments/`

#### environment.ts

```typescript
export  const environment = {

	production: false,

	remoteConfig: true,

	remoteConfigUrl: "/dashboard-config.json",

	VERSION: require('../../package.json').version,

    ...
}
```
#### dashboard-config.json
```typescript

WIDGET_BASE_URL: "https://<YOUR_CHAT21_WEB_WIDGET_URL>:4200/",

botcredendialsURL: "https://<YOUR_BOT_CREDENTIALS_URL>",

SERVER_BASE_URL: "https://<YOUR_TILEDESK_SERVER>/",

CHAT_BASE_URL: "https://<YOUR_CHAT21_IONIC_URL>/chat",

globalRemoteJSSrc: "https://<YOUR_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_1>, https://<YOUR_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_2>" // see the section below "Load external scripts"

firebaseAuth : false,

chatEngine: "mqtt", // OR YOUR CUSTOM CHAT ENGINE

updloaEngine: "native", // OR YOUR CUSTOM UPLOAD ENGINE

pushEngine:"none", // OR YOUR CUSTOM PUSH ENGINE

logLevel: "<YOUR-PREFERRED-LOG-LEVEL>",

wsUrl: 'ws://' + window.location.hostname + '/ws/'

};

```

  `Error < Warn < Info < Debug`
